## Introduction
**Little Lemon** is a local neighborhood bistro. The owners have long understood the importance of digital presence as a means of convenience and connection for their visitors.

This project aims to help Little Lemon by building a prototype of their website using the ``Django`` framework.

It involves testing different website components, from creating views to dynamic templates and building models and forms.
